# admin-panel
[WIP] A full stack admin panel application.

This is more of a Proof of Concept that developers can look/learn into and can serve for demo purposes as well. Depending on what happens after I finish this, I might build another one that has real application; turning the client side of this into a package, and giving it extensible and modular components that plugs in the admin panel and connect to your own API.

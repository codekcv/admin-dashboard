# admin-panel
[WIP] A full stack admin panel application.

This is more of a Proof of Concept that developers can look into and can serve as demo purposes. Depending on what happens after I finish this, I might build another one that has real application; turning the client side of this into a package and making it extensible and modular front-end admin panel that connects to any data source, be it RESTful or GraphQL.

## Front-End Technologies
TypeScript, React, Redux, Ant Design, CSS Modules, React Hook Form, Apollo Client

## Back-End Technologies
TypeScript, NestJS, MongoDB, TypeORM, PrismaJS, Apollo Server
